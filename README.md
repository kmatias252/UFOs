## Overview of UFO Analysis: 

The purpose of the UFO analysis was to help Dana provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings. The UFO Sightings webpage will have a table to organize UFO data and will allow users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. We will now be able to filter the data in the table by date, city, state, country, and shape. 

## Results:

The updated UFO sightings website allows the user to filter the data by inputting the desired output into one of the 5 filterable search criteria's (date, city, state, country, and shape). After filtering your search, the information in grey will automatically update based on the key words the user entered. The two images below represent the webpage in its entirety. Image 1 shows the objective and reason for why the webpage was created and image 2 shows how you can navigate your search to display the relevant data.

## Summary of Analysis:

One drawback of this webpage is that the search filters do not accommodate for misspelling. If the user types in one of the five filter search options and the spelling or capitalization is not correct you will not get the desired output and the data will not refresh to what you are looking for. 

Two recommendations I would develop are 1) instead of typing in your search option there is a drop down so you can click on the search options already provided within the five filters of the UFO webpage. This would also give the user the option to choose if they want to filter by day, month or year vs. a specific date. Another recommendation I would develop would be 2) the addition of a “new” button which would provide users with the option to input a UFO sighting and the necessary information such as date, city, state, country, shape, duration and comments so that the data is continuous versus fixed.
