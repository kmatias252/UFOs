## Overview of UFO Analysis: 

The purpose of the UFO analysis was to help Dana provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings. The UFO Sightings webpage will have a table to organize UFO data and will allow users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. We will now be able to filter the data in the table by date, city, state, country, and shape. 

## Results:

The updated UFO sightings website allows the user to filter the data by inputting the desired output into one of the 5 filterable search criteria's (date, city, state, country, and shape). After filtering your search, the information in grey will automatically update based on the key words the user entered. The two images below represent the webpage in its entirety. Image 1 shows the objective and reason for why the webpage was created and image 2 shows how you can navigate your search to display the relevant data.
